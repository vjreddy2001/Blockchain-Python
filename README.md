## Background

My new startup is focusing on building a portfolio management system that supports not only traditional assets
like gold, silver, stocks, etc, but crypto-assets as well! The problem is, there are so many coins out there! It's
a good thing you understand how HD wallets work, since I will be building out a system that can create them.

There aren't as many tools available in Python for this sort of thing, yet.
Thankfully, I have found a command line tool, `hd-wallet-derive` that supports not only BIP32, BIP39, and BIP44, but
also supports non-standard derivation paths for the most popular wallets out there today! I need to integrate
the script into the backend with Python.

Once the "universal" wallet is integrated, I can begin to manage billions of addresses across 300+ coins, giving
a serious edge against the competition.

In this project,I will only need to get 2 coins working: Ethereum and Bitcoin Testnet.
Ethereum keys are the same format on any network, so the Ethereum keys should work with custom networks or testnets.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required for this project.  

> **Important:** If you have _not_ already installed the dependencies listed below, you may do so by following the instructions found in the following guides:
  > - [HD Wallet Derive Installation Guide](Resources/HD_Wallet_Derive_Install_Guide.md) 
  > - [Blockchain TX Installation Guide](Resources/Blockchain_TX_Install_Guide.md).

**Dependencies List:**
- PHP must be installed on your operating system.

- You will need to clone the [`hd-wallet-derive`](https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive) tool.

- [`bit`](https://ofek.github.io/bit/) Python Bitcoin library.

- [`web3.py`](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py) Python Ethereum library.


## Instructions

### 1. Project setup

- Created a project directory called `wallet` and `cd` into it.

- Cloned the `hd-wallet-derive` tool into this folder and install it using the [HD Wallet Derive Installation Guide](Resources/HD_Wallet_Derive_Install_Guide.md) 

- Created a symlink called `derive` for the `hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php` script. This will clean up the command needed to run the script in our code, as we can call `./derive` instead of `./hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php`: 

  - Maked sure that I was in the top level project directory - in this case the directory named `wallet`. 
  
  - **Mac Users:** Run the following command: `ln -s hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php derive`. 
  
  - **Windows Users:** Creating symlinks is not supported by default on Windows, only reading them, so Windows users must perform the following steps:

    - Open up Git-Bash as an administrator (right-click on Git-Bash in the start menu).

    - Within `bash`, run the command `export MSYS=winsymlinks:nativestrict`.
    
    - Run the following command: `ln -s hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php derive`. 

  - Tested that I can run the `./derive` script properly, by running the following command.  

    - ```
      ./derive --key=xprv9zbB6Xchu2zRkf6jSEnH9vuy7tpBuq2njDRr9efSGBXSYr1QtN8QHRur28QLQvKRqFThCxopdS1UD61a5q6jGyuJPGLDV9XfYHQto72DAE8 --cols=path,address --coin=ZEC --numderive=3 -g
      ```
  - The output should match what you see below:
    - ```
      +------+-------------------------------------+
      | path | address                             |
      +------+-------------------------------------+
      | m/0  | t1V1Qp41kbHn159hvVXZL5M1MmVDRe6EdpA |
      | m/1  | t1Tw6iqFY1g9dKeAqPDAncaUjha8cn9SZqX |
      | m/2  | t1VGTPzBSSYd27GF8p9rGKGdFuWekKRhug4 |
      +------+-------------------------------------+
      ```

- Created a file called `wallet.py` -- this will be my universal wallet script. 

- The directory tree lookes something like this:

### 2. Setup constants

- In a separate file, `constants.py`, set the following constants:
  - `BTC = 'btc'`
  - `ETH = 'eth'`
  - `BTCTEST = 'btc-test'`

- In `wallet.py`, imported all constants: `from constants import *`

- Used these anytime I referenced these strings, both in function calls, and in setting object keys.

### 3. Generate a Mnemonic

- Generated a **new** 12 word mnemonic using `hd-wallet-derive` or by using [this tool](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

- Set this mnemonic as an environment variable by storing it a an `.env` file and importing it into your `wallet.py`.

### 4. Derive the wallet keys

- Created a function called `derive_wallets` that does the following:

  - Use the `subprocess` library to create a shell command that calls the `./derive` script from Python. Make sure to properly wait for the process. **Windows Users** may need to prepend the `php` command in front of `./derive` like so: `php ./derive`.

  - The following flags must be passed into the shell command as variables:
    - Mnemonic (`--mnemonic`) must be set from an environment variable, or default to a test mnemonic
    - Coin (`--coin`)
    - Numderive (`--numderive`) to set number of child keys generated
    - Format (`--format=json`) to parse the output into a JSON object using `json.loads(output)`

- Created a dictionary object called `coins` that uses the `derive_wallets` function to derive `ETH` and `BTCTEST` wallets.

- When done properly, the final object looked something like this (there are only 3 children each in this image):

![Screenshot python command](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83671629/136074978-a77b5ab9-afa5-4e7b-8fdf-8ab74bf24a93.png)

- I will now be able to select child accounts (and thus, private keys) by accessing items in the `coins` dictionary like so: `coins[COINTYPE][INDEX]['privkey']`.

### 5. Linking the transaction signing libraries

- Used `bit` and `web3.py` to leverage the keys stored in the `coins` object by creating three more functions:

  - `priv_key_to_account`:
  
    - This function will convert the `privkey` string in a child key to an account object that `bit` or `web3.py` can use to transact.
    - This function needs the following parameters:

      - `coin` -- the coin type (defined in `constants.py`).
      - `priv_key` -- the `privkey` string will be passed through here.

    - then return one of the following functions based on the library:

      - For `ETH`, return `Account.privateKeyToAccount(priv_key)`
          - This function returns an account object from the private key string. You can read more about this object [here](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/web3-eth-accounts.html#privatekeytoaccount).
      - For `BTCTEST`, return `PrivateKeyTestnet(priv_key)`
          - This is a function from the `bit` libarary that converts the private key string into a WIF (Wallet Import Format) object. WIF is a special format bitcoin uses to designate the types of keys it generates. 
          - You can read more about this function [here](https://ofek.dev/bit/dev/api.html).

  - `create_tx`: 
    - This function will create the raw, unsigned transaction that contains all metadata needed to transact.
    - This function needs the following parameters:

      - `coin` -- the coin type (defined in `constants.py`).
      - `account` -- the account object from `priv_key_to_account`.
      - `to` -- the recipient address.
      - `amount` -- the amount of the coin to send.

    - Checked the coin type, then return one of the following functions based on the library:

      - For `ETH`, return an object containing `to`, `from`, `value`, `gas`, `gasPrice`, `nonce`, and `chainID`.
        Make sure to calculate all of these values properly using `web3.py`!
      - For `BTCTEST`, return `PrivateKeyTestnet.prepare_transaction(account.address, [(to, amount, BTC)])`

- `send_tx`:
  - This function will call `create_tx`, sign the transaction, then send it to the designated network.
  - This function needs the following parameters:

    - `coin` -- the coin type (defined in `constants.py`).
    - `account` -- the account object from `priv_key_to_account`.
    - `to` -- the recipient address.
    - `amount` -- the amount of the coin to send.

  - You may notice these are the exact same parameters as `create_tx`. `send_tx` will call `create_tx`, so it needs all of this information available.

  - Checked the coin, then create a `raw_tx` object by calling `create_tx`. Then, I signed the `raw_tx` using `bit` or `web3.py` (hint: the account objects have a sign transaction function within).

  - Once signed the transaction, sent it to the designated blockchain network.

    - For `ETH`, return `w3.eth.sendRawTransaction(signed.rawTransaction)`
    - For `BTCTEST`, return `NetworkAPI.broadcast_tx_testnet(signed)`

### 6. Send some transactions!

- Now, I should be able to fund these wallets using testnet faucets. 
- Open up a new terminal window inside of `wallet`.
- Then ran the command `python` to open the Python shell. 
- Within the Python shell, ran the command `from wallet import *`. This will allow me to access the functions in `wallet.py` interactively.
- Set the account with  `priv_key_to_account` and used `send_tx` to send transactions.

  - **Bitcoin Testnet transaction**

    - Fund a `BTCTEST` address using [this testnet faucet](https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co/).

    - Use a [block explorer](https://tbtc.bitaps.com/) to watch transactions on the address.

    - Send a transaction to another testnet address (either one of your own, or the faucet's).

    - Screenshot the confirmation of the transaction like so:

      ![btc-test](Images/btc-test.png)

  - **Local PoA Ethereum transaction**

    - Add one of the `ETH` addresses to the pre-allocated accounts in your `networkname.json`.

    - Delete the `geth` folder in each node, then re-initialize using `geth --datadir nodeX init networkname.json`.
      This will create a new chain, and will pre-fund the new account.

    - [Add the following middleware](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/middleware.html#geth-style-proof-of-authority)
      to `web3.py` to support the PoA algorithm:

      ```
      from web3.middleware import geth_poa_middleware

      w3.middleware_onion.inject(geth_poa_middleware, layer=0)
      ```

    - Due to a bug in `web3.py`, you will need to send a transaction or two with MyCrypto first, since the
      `w3.eth.generateGasPrice()` function does not work with an empty chain. You can use one of the `ETH` address `privkey`,
      or one of the `node` keystore files.

    - Send a transaction from the pre-funded address within the wallet to another, then copy the `txid` into
      MyCrypto's TX Status, and screenshot the successful transaction like so:
